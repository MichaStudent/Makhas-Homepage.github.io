		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<b>I love 東方Project - Imperishable Night</b>
			
		<p>Here is some info from touhou wiki</p>
		<p>
			Imperishable Night contains 21 songs. Differing from the past two Windows games, Embodiment of Scarlet Devil and Perfect Cherry Blossom, it contains two stage 4 boss themes - one for Reimu Hakurei and the other for Marisa Kirisame, and an extra song for the Spell Card Practice mode-exclusive Last Word spell cards, bringing the total two higher than normal.

ZUN notes that many of the songs in this game are very fast-paced, as his goal was to impart the impression of a "race against time" to the player. He brings the old PC-98 games' music to mind as similar. As such, the staff roll theme "Eternal Dream ~ Mystical Maple" is in fact an arrangement of "Maple Dream..." from Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream.

As with all games in the series, the music from this game is a popular subject for fan-made arrangements and remixes. ZUN himself has released arrangements on his various music CDs. Before the release of Imperishable Night, "Illusionary Night ~ Ghostly Eyes" was already featured on Ghostly Field Club; "Voyage 1969", "Retribution for the Eternal Night ~ Imperishable Night" and "Eternal Dream ~ Mystical Maple" on Changeability of Strange Dream; "Flight of the Bamboo Cutter ~ Lunatic Princess", "Reach for the Moon, Immortal Smoke", and "Gensokyo Millennium ~ History of the Moon" on Retrospective 53 minutes. Various character-specific themes have also been arranged for use in the multiplayer games.

			The trial version of Imperishable Night, bearing the tag "Plus CD", was released at the first Hakurei Shrine Reitaisai on April 18, 2004. A cleaned-up downloadable demo was uploaded to ZUN's main site a month later on May 14. He released a few updates for the demo before releasing the full version at Comiket 66 on August 15, 2004.

The game was updated a few times, up to version 1.00d on September 20, 2004, the final version of the game.
